# # FDTD Lumerical
#
# gdsfactory provides you with a Lumerical FDTD interface to calculate Sparameters automatically  (without you having to click around the Lumerical GUI)
#
# The function `gplugins.lumerical.write_sparameters_lumerical` brings up a GUI, runs simulation and then writes the Sparameters both in .CSV and .DAT (Lumerical interconnect / simphony) file formats, as well as the simulation settings in YAML format.
#
# In the CSV format each Sparameter will have 2 columns, `o1@0,o2@0` where `m` stands for magnitude and `s12a` where `a` stands for angle in radians.
#
# For the simulation to wor well, your components need to have ports, that will be extended automatically to go over the PML.
#
# ![lum GUI](https://i.imgur.com/dHAzZRw.png)
#
#
# The script calls internally the lumerical python API `lumapi` so you will need to make sure that you can run this from python.
#
# ```python
# import lumapi
#
# session = lumapi.FDTD()
# ```
#
# In linux that may require you to export the PYTHONPATH variable in your shell environment.
#
# You can add one line into your `.bashrc` in your Linux machine.
#
#
# ```bash
# [ -d "/opt/lumerical" ] && export PATH=$PATH:/opt/lumerical/$(ls /opt/lumerical)/bin && export PYTHONPATH=/opt/lumerical/$(ls /opt/lumerical)/api/python
# ```
#
#
# Finally, You can chain the Sparameters to calculate solve of larger circuits using a circuit solver such as
#
# - Lumerical interconnect
# - [sax (open source)](https://sax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
